  <p class="descrip" >Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon<br>
     known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the<br>
     Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the<br>
     Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed<br>
      his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto. Now,<br>
      Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure.<br>
       Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place<br>
       in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure<br>
        leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes.
