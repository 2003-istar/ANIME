  <p class="descrip" >Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student,<br>
     who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However,<br>
     Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into<br>
      the dark depths of the ghouls' inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved<br>
      by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as<br>
      a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.<br><br><br><br></p>
